# Module 3 - Lab 2 - Exercise 1 - Manage Azure Resources


**Scenario**

In this lab, you will learn how to use Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enable just-in-time administration and control the number of users who can perform privileged operations. You will also learn about the different directory roles available as well as newer functionality that includes PIM being expanded to role assignments at the resource level. 


### Task 1: Discover resources

1.  If you are still logged into the Microsoft 365 admin center as MOD Adminsitrator switch users to Holly Dickson. Go to the **Azure Portal** `https://portal.azure.com/` and sign in as Global Administrator Holly Dickson, click **All services** then search for and select `Azure AD Privileged Identity Management`.

1.  Click consent to PIM if it appears. In some tenants PIM is already enabled and therefore these steps are unnecessary.

1.  If **Verify my identity** appears, follow the verification steps by entering your phone number, entering the code and then click **Done**.
1.  In the Azure Portal, click **All services** and search for and select **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.
1.  Click consent to PIM if it appears > **Consent** > **Yes**.
1.  Refresh the Azure Portal by pressing **F5**.
   
    **Note**: If by refreshing the portal in the browser does not display PIM as being enabled then log out and back into the Azure Portal.
