# Module 9 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Initialize Compliance 

In your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Security Administrator, you have Microsoft 365 deployed in a virtualized lab environment. As you proceed with your Microsoft 365 pilot project, your next steps are to implement archiving and retention at Adatum.  

### Task 1 – Activate In-Place Archiving

In this next phase of your Adatum pilot project, you will access the Security & Compliance Center to activate Holly Dickson’s archive mailbox.

1. Login into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the LON-CL1\Admin account, and you should be logged in with Holly Dickson and credentials given in Lab Environment Details Page.

2. Go to the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/). Click **Information governance** in the left pane (you might to click **... Show all** at the bottom before it appears). In the **Information governance** window, click the **Archive** tab.

3. On the **Archive** window, note that the archive mailboxes for all users other than Holly Dickson are enabled. These archive mailboxes were enabled when the VMs were built for this training course and these users were preconfigured in the tenant. However, since you added Holly in an earlier lab, her archive mailbox is disabled by default.

4. To enable Holly’s archive mailbox, type Holly in **Search** box at top right and enter, click the three vertical dots to the right of the name, click the three vertical dots to the right of the name, then click **Enable archive** on the submenu that opens. 


5. On the **Warning** screen that opens, click **Enable** to confirm. 

6. Back on the **Archive** tab, click **Refresh** to see that the **Archive mailbox** status for all users has changed to **Enabled**.
